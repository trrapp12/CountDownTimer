### Description:
---

This is a tutorial project offered on [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos)'s [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.


The course demonstrates the following:
- [x] Correct use of JavaScript functions, loops
- [x] Adding EventListeners to the DOM and buttons and using preventDefault()
- [x] Use of Date.now()
- [x] Use of querySelector() and querySelectorAll()
- [x] Use of template literals `` ` ``  and placeholders `&{}`

### Instructions on how to launch:
---

1. Create a Folder to hold the program
 > - in the terminal type `mkdir CountDownTimer` or whatever other name you want to call it. 
 > - navigate into the folder by typing `cd CountDownTimer`
 > - clone the program into the Hangman folder you just created by typing: 
 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/trrapp12/CountDownTimer.git
 ```
  <br/>
  
2. Make sure you are still in the CountDownTimer folder.
 <br/>
 
3. From the CountDownTimer folder, on the terminal, type `cd CountDownTimer`. 
<br/>

### A few changes I made:
---

ðŸ†• updated CSS.

ðŸ†• changed time intervals.

<br/>
<br/>

### Next Steps for my v.2.0:
---
- [ ] Create circle animation for countdown.
- [ ] Create functionality to go multiple rounds with programmable rest times.
- [ ] Adjust circle animation for every interval and every wait.
- [ ] Add "+" and "-" buttons to add or decrement time.
- [ ] Publish in a format I can use on my phone for my own boxing workouts.

ðŸ†• Add boxing sounds to indicate start of round.

ðŸ†• Add boxing sounds to indicate 10 sec warning and end of round.

ðŸ†• Add boxing sounds to indicate end of round.

ðŸ†• Add functionality so the sound will stop when you click a new button, so the start bell will always coordinate with you clicking a new button.

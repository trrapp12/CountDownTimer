### Description:
---

This is a tutorial project offered on [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos)'s [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.


The course demonstrates the following:
- [x] Correct use of JavaScript functions, loops
- [x] Adding EventListeners to the DOM and buttons and using preventDefault()
- [x] Use of Date.now()
- [x] Use of querySelector() and querySelectorAll()
- [x] Use of template literals `` ` ``  and placeholders `&{}`

### Instructions on how to launch:
---

1. Create a Folder to hold the program
 > - in the terminal type `mkdir CountDownTimer` or whatever other name you want to call it. 
 > - navigate into the folder by typing `cd CountDownTimer`
 > - clone the program into the Hangman folder you just created by typing: 
 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/trrapp12/CountDownTimer.git
 ```
  <br/>
  
2. Make sure you are still in the CountDownTimer folder.
 <br/>
 
3. From the CountDownTimer folder, on the terminal, type `cd CountDownTimer`. 
<br/>

4. Type `start index.html` to run the program from the terminal. 
<br/>

5. Enjoy!

### A few changes I made:
---

- [x] updated CSS.
- [x] changed time intervals.

### Next Steps for my v.2.0:
---
- [ ] Create circle animation for countdown.
- [ ] Create functionality to go multiple rounds with programmable rest times.
- [ ] Add "+" and "-" buttons to add or decrement time.
- [ ] Publish in a format I can use on my phone for my own boxing workouts.
- [ ] Add boxing sounds to indicate 10 sec warning and end of round.

### How to Use:


1. Create a Folder to hold the program
 > - in the terminal type `mkdir CountDownTimer` or whatever other name you want to call it. 
 > - navigate into the folder by typing `cd CountDownTimer`
 > - clone the program into the Hangman folder you just created by typing: 
 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/trrapp12/CountDownTimer.git
 ```
  <br/>
  
2. Make sure you are still in the CountDownTimer folder.
 <br/>
 
3. From the CountDownTimer folder, on the terminal, type `cd CountDownTimer`. 
<br/>

4. Type `start index.html` to run the program from the terminal.
